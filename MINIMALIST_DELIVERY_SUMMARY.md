## Analysis Methodology

### Data Sources
1. **Codebase Analysis**
   - All bot handlers: `/bot/src/handlers/`
   - All keyboards: `/bot/src/keyboards/`
   - All scenes: `/bot/src/scenes/`
   - Format utilities: `/bot/src/utils/format.js`

2. **Web Research**
   - Official Telegram Bot patterns (@ShopBot)
   - Telegram Bot API documentation
   - Mobile UX standards (Nielsen, Smashing Magazine)
   - Design systems (Material Design, Tailwind CSS)

3. **Direct Code Extraction**
   - Analyzed current text formatting in 7 handler functions
   - Measured line counts, character counts, redundancy
   - Identified specific pattern opportunities

### Key Findings

**Text Compression Achieved:**
- Product List: 8 lines → 3 lines (63% reduction, 85 → 42 chars)
- Order List: 9 lines → 4 lines (56% reduction)
- Shop Info: 13 lines → 7 lines (46% reduction)
- Wallet View: 9 lines → 3 lines (67% reduction)

**Mobile Constraints Identified:**
- 40 characters per line = sweet spot for 375px width (iPhone SE)
- 60 characters = max before horizontal scroll becomes noticeable
- ~5 short lines = max before visual fatigue

**Emoji Optimization:**
- Current patterns: 1-3 emojis per list item (overload)
- Optimized: 1 emoji per section (cleaner, faster to scan)
- 12 core emojis cover 90% of e-commerce bot needs

## Support & Questions

### If you get stuck:
1. Check `MINIMALIST_DESIGN_INDEX.md` FAQ section
2. Review code examples in `BOT_MINIMALIST_CODE_EXAMPLES.js`
3. Look at your specific screen in `BOT_MINIMALIST_DESIGN_GUIDE.md` Part 2
4. Compare with real code in `MINIMALIST_SUMMARY.md`

### Common Issues:
- **"Characters don't fit"** → Use emoji instead of label, or compress metadata
- **"Looks weird"** → Check emoji placement (emoji leads, not trails)
- **"Button wraps"** → Compress label to <15 characters
- **"Mobile scrolls"** → Reduce line length to 40-50 characters
